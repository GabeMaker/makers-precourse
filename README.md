## Useful links and further reading from study:

**Command Line**
- [vi cheat sheet](http://www.lagmonster.org/docs/vi.html)
- [recovering files deleted with 'rm'](http://superuser.com/questions/751756/is-rm-reversible)
- These [regex examples](http://www.thegeekstuff.com/2011/01/regular-expressions-in-grep-command/) helped with task 5 of the challenge
- [command substitution](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/Command-Substitution.html) usage and syntax helped with task 8

**Sublime Text**
- [deleting blank lines](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12008986/sublime-text-2-how-to-delete-blank-empty-lines) (find and replace / regex)

**Ruby**
- [Practicing Ruby](https://practicingruby.com) which I found through an article mentioning [choose your own adventure books](https://practicingruby.com/articles/confident-ruby) while playing with LRtHW ex31


## Misc

**Week 1**

- Command Line Exercises: I used [this link](http://askubuntu.com/questions/151674/how-do-i-insert-a-line-at-the-top-of-a-text-file-using-the-command-line) while trying to add a shebang to the top of the hello.rb file without leaving command line. I couldn't get the 'sed' command working (I inserted the shebang but could not create a newline after it). In the end I created a newfile1 (with the shebang) and newfile2 (a copy of the ruby code) and used 'cat newfile1 newfile2 > hello.rb' to do this part

- Challenge: The **'sort'** command wasn't in the walkthrough but found it through Google while doing task 13
